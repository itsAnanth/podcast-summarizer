Jensen Huang is the CEO of NVIDIA, the company that led a fundamental shift in how computers work. A huge amount of the most futuristic tech that you're hearing about in AI and robotics and gaming relies on new chips and software designed by him and his company.
I'm not going to ask you any questions about - you could ask - company finances, thank you! I think that our audience can get them well covered elsewhere. What we do on huge if true is we make optimistic explainer videos and we've covered - I'm the worst person to be an explainer video. I think you might be the best.
In the early '90s NVIDIA came up with a solution that would change not just games but computing itself. The company set out to build a company to solve computer problems that normal computers can't.
Video games requires parallel processing for processing 3D graphics. A GPU is like a time machine because it lets you see the future sooner. Jensen Huang: Video games has potential to be the largest market for entertainment ever.
 NVIDIA's CUDA platform lets programmers tell the GPU what to do using programming languages that they already know like C. It's allowing us to create worlds in computers that we never could have before, and it's revolutionizing all of these other industries as well.
The first external ideas of using our GPUs for parallel processing emerged out of some interesting work in medical imaging. And so we have a natural reason to want to do it in the market that we were serving. Fundamentally the reason why I was certain that CUDA was going to be successful and we put the whole company behind it was because fundamentally our GPU was going be the highest volume parallel processors built in the world.
In 2012, a group of three researchers submits an entry to a famous competition where the goal is to create computer systems that could recognize images and label them with categories. Their entry just crushes the competition. It's called AlexNet, and it's a kind of AI called the neural network.
Krizhevsky and Geoff Hinton in the University of Toronto the lab that they were at they reached out to a gForce GTX 580 because they learned about CUDA. The thing that really caught our attention was simultaneously we were trying to solve the computer vision problem inside the company. And so we were we were highly interested to want to see it work.
DGX is a new type of computer that uses deep neural networks to solve machine learning problems. The technology has the potential to reshape the computer industry altogether. DGX is the result of an effort to re-engineer the entire computing stack.
 NVIDIA CEO: "There's always some problem and then there's some reason to be to be impatient" "If you feel like you're going in the right direction, we just keep on going"
I've believed in NVIDIA for 30 plus years and I'm still here working every single day. There's no fundamental reason for me to change my belief system. I fundamentally believe that the work we're doing in revolutionizing computing is as true today as it was before.
Deep learning. have the ability to learn patterns and relationships from a whole bunch of different types of data. And that it can learn more and more nuanced features if it could be larger and larger. Data is basically digital versions of human experience.
It feels like we are on the cusp of this truly enormous change. I don't think I can predict anymore how I will be using the technology that is currently being developed. The next 10 years is going to be the application science of AI.
We might be about to see a huge leap in what all of these robots are capable of because we're changing how we train them. Up until recently you've either had to train your robot in the real world where it could get damaged or wear down. Now we're starting to train robots in digital worlds, which means way more repetitions a day, way more conditions, learning way faster.
ChatGPT is a reference for understanding Omniverse and Cosmos. The world model, we need a foundation model just like we need ChatGPT. It has to understand things like gravity, friction, inertia, geometric and spatial awareness.
Omniverse uses physics simulation which is based on principled solvers. The mathematics is Newtonian physics is the, right, it's the math we know. And it's encoded into, captured into Omniverse.
Cleo: "Everything that moves will be robotic someday and it will be soon" "I'm just excited about having my own R2-D2," she says.
There is a lot that could go wrong. We should talk about what could gowrong so we could keep it from from going wrong. The spectrum of areas we have to be concerned about is fairly clear and there's a lot of people who are working on it.
 AI safety is upheld by making sure that the product functions properly. And then and then lastly you know whatever what happens if the system, the AI wants to do a good job but the system failed. And so this is no different than a flight computer inside a plane having three versions of them.
The amount of energy that we have limits what we can get done. get done within the limitations of the energy that you have. And so that's a physical limit and the laws of physics about transporting information. In the meantime, we seek to build better and more energy efficient computers.
As applications of technology get more specific, I'm thinking of transformers in AI for example. You could build chips that are perfectly suited for just one kind of AI model, but if you do that then you're making them less able to do other things. There's a debate between how much you place these bets on "burning them into the chip" or designing hardware that is very specific to a certain task.
Inventors and innovators and software programmers and AI researchers swim in the soup and come up with some amazing ideas. The fundamental characteristic of a transformer is this idea called "attention mechanism" and it basically says the transformer is going to understand the meaning of every single word.
The way we do it is even though we have things made like for example our chips are made by TSMC, we assume that we need to have the deep expertise that TSMC has. And so we have people in our company who are incredibly good at semiconductive physics so that we have a feeling for, we have an intuition for what are the limits of what today's semiconductor physics can do.
The next 5 years are going to be very interesting in the world of human robotics. We're just seeing the beginnings of that work. Of course the work that we're doing with human robots, developing the tooling systems and the training systems.
"We need time machines in all of these areas that we just talked about so that we can see the future" "I love the work that we're doing in climate science and be able to, from weather predictions, understand and predict the high resolution regional climates"
There are several ways to reason about the future that we're creating. What would happen if all of a sudden we had highways in this country? What would happened if a video conference made it possible for us to see each other without having to travel anymore?
The next the next decade intelligence, not for everything but for for some things, would basically become superhuman. I can tell you exactly what that feels like. I'm surrounded by superhuman people, super intelligence from my perspective because they're the best in the world at what they do.
This is a new GeForce graphics card and yes and this is the RTX 50 Series. It is essentially a supercomputer that you put into your PC and we use it for gaming. The real breakthrough here is this is truly an amazing thing, GeForce enabled AI and it enabled Geoff Hinton, Ilya Sutskever, Alex Krizhevsky to train AlexNet.
In 2016 I built the first one for AI researchers and we delivered the firstOne to Open AI and Elon was there to receive it. This version I built a mini mini version and the reason for that is because AI has now gone from AI researchers to every engineer, every student, every AI scientist. And AI is going to be everywhere.
How can I use AI to do my job better? That question should be persistent across everybody. My generation grew up as the first generation that has to ask ourselves, how can we use computers to do our jobs better?
The next generation doesn't have to ask that question but it has to ask obviously next question, how can I use AI to do my job better? It's a really exciting and scary and therefore worthwhile question I think for everyone.
"I think that we're fortunate because of some core beliefs a long time ago and sticking with those core beliefs and building upon them" "I do think that when we look back in a few years, and I do hope that what the next generation realized is as they're going to know us"
Our understanding of material sciences. has been transformed. That robots are helping us do dangerous and mundane things all over the place. I hope for that to be what the next generation learn.
